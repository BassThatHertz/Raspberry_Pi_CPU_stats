# Instructions:
- Save stats.sh to your Raspberry Pi.
- Set permission with `chmod +x stats.sh`
- cd into the directory that stats.sh is in, then enter `./stats.sh`
- If you want to continually monitor the stats, enter `watch -n1 ./stats.sh` (where '1' is the update frequency in seconds. Alter if necessary).
